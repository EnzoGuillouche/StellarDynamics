# StellarDynamics

**StellarDynamics** is a simulation of the solar system using VPython. It visualizes how planets orbit around the Sun, incorporating factors such as their mass, velocity, and gravitational forces. This project allows users to explore the mechanics of our solar system in an interactive 3D environment.

## Features

- **Planetary Orbits**: Realistic simulation of planetary orbits around the Sun, based on physics principles like gravitational attraction and velocity.
- **Camera Navigation**: A camera system to navigate through the simulation and explore the solar system from different angles and perspectives.
- **Interactive Simulation**: Ability to interact with the simulation, view planetary details, and observe the movement of celestial bodies.

## Requirements

- Python 3.12.4 or more recent
- VPython 7.6.5 or more recent (for 3D visualization and simulation)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/EnzoGuillouche/StellarDynamics.git
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies:

    ```bash
    pip install vpython
    ```

3. Run the simulation:

    ```bash
    .\launchSimulation.sh
    ```

## Usage

Upon running the simulation, you will see the solar system with the Sun at the center and the planets orbiting around it.

Use the camera controls to navigate through the simulation and explore the system.

You can modify the parameters of planets (such as mass, velocity) in the code to observe how these changes affect their orbits.
