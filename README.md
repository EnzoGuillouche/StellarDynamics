# StellarDynamics üååüöÄ

**StellarDynamics** is an interactive 3D simulation of the solar system, built with the power of VPython. It visualizes the majestic orbits of planets around the Sun, bringing celestial mechanics to life by considering factors such as mass, velocity, and gravitational forces. This project invites you to explore the wonders of our solar system in an immersive and educational way.

## Features ‚ú®

- **Realistic Planetary Orbits**: Watch as planets orbit the Sun based on realistic physics, including gravitational attraction and orbital velocity. Understand the beauty of orbital dynamics firsthand.
  
- **Camera Navigation**: Take control of your view with a camera system that allows you to zoom in on planets, move across space, and view the solar system from different perspectives. Feel like you're truly navigating through the stars!

- **Interactive Exploration**: Change planetary properties like mass or velocity and see how these changes affect their orbits. Observe the complex dance of celestial bodies as you interact with the simulation.

- **Web Tab**: The simulation will launch in your web browser, allowing you to explore and experiment with ease directly from a dynamic interface.

## Requirements ‚öôÔ∏è

- Python 3.12.4 or higher
- VPython 7.6.5 or higher (for 3D visualization and simulation)

## Installation üõ†Ô∏è

1. **Clone the repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/EnzoGuillouche/StellarDynamics.git
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies:

    ```bash
    pip install vpython
    ```

3. Run the simulation:

    For *Linux/macOS*:

    ```bash
    ./launchSimulation.sh
    ```

    For *Windows* (using PowerShell):

    ```bash
    .\launchSimulation.ps1
    ```

4. Experience the simulation:

Once the simulation is running, a web tab will open in your default browser, displaying the solar system simulation in 3D. From here, you can start navigating and exploring the planets, their orbits, and more.

## Usage üåç

**Navigating the Simulation**:

- _Zoom_: Use the scroll wheel to zoom in and out.

- _Pan_: Click and drag to move the camera across the scene.

- _Orbit_: Hold the right mouse button and drag to orbit around a planet.

- _Jump to a Planet_: Click on any planet to focus the camera on it.

**Modifying Planet Properties**:

Open the code file and adjust parameters such as mass, velocity, or orbital distance to see how these changes affect the orbital paths.

Watch how the orbits change dynamically as the physical laws take effect.
